CN17,dysfunctional_dna_repair,HR,HR deficiency,"CN17 is a signature of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Evidence for this comes from positive associations with mono- or bi-allelic losses of BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, FBXW7 and CDK12, a positive association with HR pathway abrogation more generally, and the strongest positive association with scarHRD scores (a score of genomic scars of homologous recombination deficiency, see Sztupinszki et al., 2018). In addition, CN17 associates with promoter hypermethylation of BRCA1 in breast cancer, and with SBS3 (a single base substitution signature associates with homologous recombination deficiency), ID6 (an indel signature associated with homologous recombination deficiency), and ID8 (an indel signature associated with non homologous end joining, which is often preferred when homologous recombination is unavailable) in whole-genome-sequencing derived signature assignments. In addition, CN17 is positively associated with SBS2 and SBS13 (single base substitution signatures associates with APOBEC activity, and often observed near rearrangements/double strand breaks) in exome-derived signature assignments. CN17 is further positively associates with TP53 mutations in multiple cancers.

Hypoxia has been shown to downregulate homologous recombination (see Bindra et al., 2004), making it possible that some of the attribution of CN17 is related to hypoxia as opposed to true HRD, however, associations with e.g. BRCA1 mutation status, suggest CN17 is at least partially a true signature of HRD",Mutational Signatures (v3.4 - October 2023),Statistical association,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/cn/,CN17 · GRCh37 · COSMIC v100,Number of segments attributed to the copy number signature across the cancer types in which it was found.
