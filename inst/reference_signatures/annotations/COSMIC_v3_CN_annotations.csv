CN1,ploidy,diploid, Diploidy,"CN1 is primarily a signature of a diploid genome. This has been verified through associations with non-genome-doubled samples and simulations of little or no copy number alteration. CN1 is also negatively associated with many signals of a perturbed genome, as might be expected for a diploid signature, including APOBEC SBS signatures (SBS2, SBS13), TP53 mutation in multiple cancer types, biomarkers of homologous recombination deficiency (scarHRD scores, see Sztupinszki et al., 2018), all amplicon classes, all rearrangement classes other than translocations, chromothripsis calls, LOH, tandem duplicator phenotype (see Menghi et al., 2018), hypoxia gene expression scores (see Eustace et al., 2013 & Yang et al., 2018) and oncogene amplification in many cancer types.","However, if CN1 is observed at <<100% proportion of segments, it may instead indicate aneuploidy, with unaltered segments being given CN1, and altered segments being given any other signature.",CN1 · GRCh37 · COSMIC v98,Mutational Signatures (v3.3 - June 2022),Steele et al. 2022 Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04738-6,,, Statistical association, No,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/cn/cn1/
CN2,ploidy,tetraploid, Ploidy gain (1x)/aneuploidy,"CN2 is primarily a signature of a tetraploid genome; this has been verified through associations with once-genome-doubled samples, simulations of genome doubling, and artificial genome doubling of signature CN1. Note that due to the copy number class that most strongly defines this signature (TCN 3-4), a triploid cancer may be assigned this signature.","However, if CN2 is observed at <<100% proportion of segments, it may instead indicate aneuploidy, with gained segments (on a diploid background) being assigned CN2, and unaltered segments being assigned CN1 or lost segments being assigned CN9 or CN13, depending on size and genomic background.",CN2 · GRCh37 · COSMIC v98,Mutational Signatures (v3.3 - June 2022),Steele et al. 2022 Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04738-6,,, Statistical association, No,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/cn/cn2/
CN3,ploidy,octoploid, Ploidy gain (2x)/aneuploidy,  ,"CN3 is primarily a signature of an octoploid genome, however this signature has more varied segment sizes than CN1 or CN2 which may indicate a greater effect of chromosomal instability on a octoploid genome. This has been verified through simulations of twice genome doubling combined with strong chromosomal instability, and associations with twice-genome-doubled samples. Note that due to the copy number class that most strongly defines this signature (TCN 5-8), a cancer that is anywhere from pentaploid to octoploid may be assigned this signature.",CN3 · GRCh37 · COSMIC v98,Mutational Signatures (v3.3 - June 2022),Steele et al. 2022 Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04738-6,,, Statistical association, No,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/cn/cn3/
CN4,chromosomal,chromothripsis, Chromothripsis,"CN4 was only identified in uveal melanoma (see tumour distributions), in <5% of samples. Despite the low numbers, samples with a high attribution of CN4 display high localised segmentation, suggesting a chromothripsis-like aetiology. In addition, this signature is associated with highly rearranged amplicons (see Kim et al., 2020), and was observed in simulations of chromothripsis with a gain of the derivative chromosome.","In combination with other amplicon/chromothripsis signatures, CN4 is associated with poorer disease specific survival.",CN4 · GRCh37 · COSMIC v98,Mutational Signatures (v3.3 - June 2022),Steele et al. 2022 Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04738-6,,, Statistical association, No,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/cn/cn4/
CN5,chromosomal,chromothripsis, Chromothripsis,"CN5 is a signature of chromothripsis/amplicon events. Evidence for this comes from associations with local calls of chromothripsis in PCAWG (see PCAWG consortium, 2020) and simulations of chromothripsis with amplification of the derivative chromosome. In addition, CN5 is associated with the circular amplicon class (ECDNA) (see Kim et al., 2020), which has been shown to have an interplay with chromothripsis and breakage-fusion bridge events (see e.g. Bolhaquiero et al., 2019).","CN5 is associated with a poorer prognosis for patients in a pan-cancer analysis, with a poorer prognosis in just glioblastomas, and with a poorer prognosis when taken in combination with all other chromothripsis/amplicon signatures.",CN5 · GRCh37 · COSMIC v98,Mutational Signatures (v3.3 - June 2022),Steele et al. 2022 Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04738-6,,, Statistical association, No,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/cn/cn5/
CN6,chromosomal,chromothripsis, Chromothripsis,"CN6 is a signature of chromothripsis/amplicon events followed by genome doubling (LOH segments are lost through chromothripsis, and then gained due to genome doubling). Evidence for this comes from associations with local calls of chromothripsis in PCAWG, local calls of chromothripsis before whole genome doubling in PCAWG (see PCAWG consortium, 2020), associations with samples that are once-genome-doubled, and through simulations of chromothripsis followed by genome doubling.","In addition, CN6 associates strongly with the circular amplicon class (ECDNA), and less strongly with the linear and heavily rearranged amplicon classes (see Kim et al., 2020). CN6 is also associated with chromothripsis, deletion and tyfonas rearrangement classes (see Hadi et al., 2020).",CN6 · GRCh37 · COSMIC v98,Mutational Signatures (v3.3 - June 2022),Steele et al. 2022 Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04738-6,,, Statistical association, No,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/cn/cn6/

Evidence for this comes from associations with local calls of chromothripsis in PCAWG, local calls of amplified chromothripsis in PCAWG (see PCAWG consortium, 2020), associations with samples that are once- or twice-genome-doubled, and through simulations of chromothripsis with amplification of the derivative chromosome and genome doubling. CN7 strongly associates with circular, heavily rearranged and linear amplicon classes, and less strongly with breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) amplicon events (see Kim et al., 2020).","CN7 is positively associated with BFB, chromoplexy, and tyfonas rearrangement classes (see Hadi et al., 2020) and with poor disease specific survival for patients in combination with other chromothripsis/amplicon signatures.",CN7 · GRCh37 · COSMIC v98,Mutational Signatures (v3.3 - June 2022),Steele et al. 2022 Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04738-6,,, Statistical association, No,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/cn/cn7/
CN8,chromosomal,chromothripsis, Chromothripsis,"CN8 is a signature of amplified chromothripsis. Evidence for this comes from associations with local calls of chromothripsis in PCAWG, local calls of amplified chromothripsis in PCAWG (see PCAWG consortium, 2020), associations with samples that are once- or twice-genome-doubled, and through simulations of chromothripsis multiple amplifications of the derivative chromosome and genome doubling. In addition, CN8 is strongly associated with breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB), circular (ECDNA), heavily rearranged and linear amplicon classes (see Kim et al., 2020), and associated with BFB, chromothripsis and tyfonas rearrangement classes, amongst others (see Hadi et al., 2020).","CN8 positively associates with RAF1 and CCNE1 amplification in bladder cancer, MDM2 amplification in glioblastoma, AKT2 and NSD3 amplification in high grade serous ovarian cancer, MDM2 and JUN amplification in sarcomas, CCNE1 amplification in stomach adenocarcinoma and KAT6A amplification in uterine/endometrial carcinoma. In addition, CN8 was observed to locally recur around oncogenes that are important drivers of individual tumour types e.g. SOX2 in lung squamous cell carcinoma, EGFR in glioblastoma and uterine/endometrial carcinoma, MYC in uterine/endometrial carcinoma, CCND1 in esophageal carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, MDM2 and NKX2-1 and PPM1D in sarcomas, ERBB2 in stomach adenocarcinoma, and CCNE1 in high grade serous ovarian carcinoma.",CN8 · GRCh37 · COSMIC v98,Mutational Signatures (v3.3 - June 2022),Steele et al. 2022 Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04738-6,,, Statistical association, No,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/cn/cn8/
CN9,chromosomal,chromosomal_instability, Chromosomal instability,"CN9 is a signature of chromosomal instability on a diploid background. Evidence for this comes from both simulations of chromosomal instability and simulations of chromothripsis (N.B. that there is no current signature of ‘canonical chromothripsis’; this is difficult to distinguish from the effects of regular chromosomal instability with the current classification system). In addition, CN9 is associated with non-genome-doubled samples.","CN9 is associated with both deletion and duplication rearrangement classes (see Hadi et al., 2020), as well as with regions of the genome that are LOH.",CN9 · GRCh37 · COSMIC v98,Mutational Signatures (v3.3 - June 2022),Steele et al. 2022 Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04738-6,,, Simulation, No,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/cn/cn9/

CN17,dysfunctional_dna_repair,HR, HR deficiency,"CN17 is a signature of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Evidence for this comes from positive associations with mono- or bi-allelic losses of BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, FBXW7 and CDK12, a positive association with HR pathway abrogation more generally, and the strongest positive association with scarHRD scores (a score of genomic scars of homologous recombination deficiency, see Sztupinszki et al., 2018).
