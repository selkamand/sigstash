SBS1,clock-like,clock-like, Spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine,An endogenous mutational process initiated by spontaneous or enzymatic deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine which generates G:T mismatches in double stranded DNA. Failure to detect and remove these mismatches prior to DNA replication results in fixation of the T substitution for C.,Signature SBS1 is clock-like in that the number of mutations in most cancers and normal cells correlates with the age of the individual. Rates of acquisition of Signature SBS1 mutations over time differ markedly between different cancer types and different normal cell types. These differences correlate with estimated rates of stem cell division in different tissues and Signature SBS1 may therefore be a cell division/mitotic clock.,Mutational Signatures (v3.3 - June 2022),Nik-Zainal et al. 2012 Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.04.024,,, Mutational pattern, Yes,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/sbs1/
SBS2,cytidine_deaminases,cytidine_deaminases, APOBEC activity,"Attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases on the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems. APOBEC3A is probably responsible for most mutations in human cancer, although APOBEC3B may also contribute (these differ in the sequence context two bases 5’ to the mutated cytosine, see 1,536 mutation classification signature extraction). SBS2 mutations may be generated directly by DNA replication across uracil or by error prone polymerases replicating across abasic sites generated by base excision repair removal of uracil.","SBS2 is usually found in the same samples as SBS13. It has been proposed that activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases in cancer may be due to previous viral infection, retrotransposon jumping, or tissue inflammation. Currently, there is limited evidence to support these hypotheses. Germline polymorphisms involving APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B are associated with predisposition to breast and bladder cancer as well as with mutation burdens of SBS2 and SBS13. Mutations of similar patterns to SBS2 and SBS13 are commonly found in the phenomenon of local hypermutation present in some cancers, known as kataegis, implicating AID/APOBEC enzymes in this process as well.",Mutational Signatures (v3.3 - June 2022),Nik-Zainal et al. 2012 Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.04.024,Chan et al. 2015 Nature Genetics,https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3378, Experimental confirmation, Yes,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/sbs2/
SBS3,dysfunctional_dna_repair,HR, HR deficiency,Defective homologous recombination-based DNA damage repair which manifests predominantly as small indels and genome rearrangements due to abnormal double strand break repair but also in the form of this base substitution signature.,"SBS3 is strongly associated with germline and somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and BRCA1 promoter methylation in breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. In pancreatic cancer, responders to platinum therapy usually exhibit SBS3 mutations.

SBS5,clock-like,clock-like, Aging / Tobacco smoking / NER deficiency,Unknown. SBS5 mutational burden is increased in bladder cancer samples with ERCC2 mutations and in many cancer types due to tobacco smoking.,SBS5 is clock-like in that the number of mutations in most cancers and normal cells correlates with the age of the individual. Rates of acquisition of SBS5 mutations over time differ between different cancer types and different normal cell types. These differences do not clearly correlate with estimated rates of stem cell division in different tissues nor with differences in SBS1 mutation rates.

SBS7c is possibly the consequence of translesion DNA synthesis by enzymes with propensity to insert T, rather than A, opposite ultraviolet induced thymidine and cytidine photodimers.
