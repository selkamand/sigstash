DBS2,environmental_mutagens,tobacco, Tobacco smoking / Acetaldehyde exposure,"Exposure to tobacco smoking as well as other endogenous and/or exogenous mutagens (e.g., acetaldehyde).","DBS2 exhibits transcriptional strand bias with more GG>TT mutations than CC>AA on the untranscribed strands of genes indicative of damage on guanine and repair by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. In addition to its presence in tobacco smoking induced cancers, DBS2 is also found in many cancer types unrelated to tobacco smoking. Its profile is similar to that of mutations in normal cells in mice. It may therefore also be an endogenously generated signature. Its mutation burden correlates with age of cancer diagnosis and this clock-like feature suggests that it is generated in normal human cells.",Mutational Signatures (v3.3 - June 2022),Chen et al. 2013 Human Mutation,https://doi.org/10.1002/humu.22341,Kucab et al. 2019 Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.03.001, Experimental confirmation (tobacco smoking), Yes,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/dbs/dbs2/
