"https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/id/id8/","COSMIC | ID8 - Mutational Signatures"," DSB repair by NHEJ / TOP2A mutation","Appears to be caused by at least two underlying mechanisms. In the vast majority of tumours the aetiology is unknown, but may involve repair of DNA double strand breaks by non-homologous DNA end-joining mechanisms. The double strand breaks could, in principle, be radiation induced and the features of ID8 mutations have some similarities to those of radiation induced mutations. The small number of tumors with the somatic p.K743N mutation in topoisomerase TOP2A, which always also have ID17, have a form of ID8 that shows evidence of transcription-associated damage and that has a strong enrichment for deletions of 6 to 8 base pairs compared to other ID8-mutated tumours. The vast majority of ID8 tumours (which do not have ID17) do not show evidence of transcription-coupled damage and have a markedly different size distribution of deletions longer than 5 base pairs.","The ID8 mutation burden is correlated with age of cancer diagnosis and this clock-like behaviour suggests that ID8 mutations may accumulate in normal cells.","ID8 · GRCh37 · COSMIC v98","Mutational Signatures (v3.3 - June 2022)","Alexandrov et al. 2020 Nature","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3","",""," Statistical association"," Yes"
