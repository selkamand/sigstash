Failure to detect and remove these mismatches prior to DNA replication results in fixation of the T substitution for C.","Signature SBS1 is clock-like in that the number of mutations in most cancers and normal cells correlates with the age of the individual. Rates of acquisition of Signature SBS1 mutations over time differ markedly between different cancer types and different normal cell types. These differences correlate with estimated rates of stem cell division in different tissues and Signature SBS1 may therefore be a cell division/mitotic clock.","SBS1 · GRCh37 · COSMIC v98","Mutational Signatures (v3.3 - June 2022)","Nik-Zainal et al. 2012 Cell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.04.024","",""," Mutational pattern"," Yes"

APOBEC3A is probably responsible for most mutations in human cancer, although APOBEC3B may also contribute (these differ in the sequence context two bases 5’ to the mutated cytosine, see 1,536 mutation classification signature extraction). SBS2 mutations may be generated directly by DNA replication across uracil or by error prone polymerases replicating across abasic sites generated by base excision repair removal of uracil.","SBS2 is usually found in the same samples as SBS13.
